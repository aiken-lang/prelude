# Aiken Prelude

This repository contains a representation of the Aiken implicit prelude. This constitutes all the types and basic functions that are globally available in Aiken. **This module isn't meant to be imported** as a dependency (for it is already imported and available by default), but exists for documentation purpose.

If you found this by chance, we recommend looking only at the [rendered documentation ðŸ“˜](https://aiken-lang.github.io/prelude) or jump right into [Aiken's user manual](https://aiken-lang.org/).
